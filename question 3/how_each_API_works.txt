Here's how each API works:

The first API (/api) takes an ENO parameter from the query string, searches for an employee with that ENO in the employees array, and returns the employee details if found.

The second API (/api/employeesByDname) takes a DNAME parameter from the query string, filters the employees array to find employees in the specified department, and returns a list of matching employees.

Both APIs handle exceptions and provide error responses when necessary. They are also type-safe by parsing input parameters into integers to ensure that they match the expected data types.

You can run this Node.js application, and it will serve these two APIs on port 9000. You can then use a tool like Postman to test the APIs by making HTTP requests to endpoints like http://localhost:9000/api?ENO=1 and http://localhost:9000/api/employeesByDname?DNAME=10, where you can replace the parameter values as needed for testing.
